# Project 0: Tic Tac Toe

### Firebase Branch 

* In this branch I experiment with Firebase database and attempt a stretch goal of creating a networked app and potentially a login system with Node.js and passport. 

### Goals

- [ ] Get the inital player one and two object data and persist it to the firebase database references
- [ ] Create and update player choices arrays
- [ ] Delete player choices arrays on `game.clearBoard()`
- [ ] Update win/loss results on win or loss 
- [ ] Pull the whole database object and set it 



//Send out the email to player 2
        //Tell player one that it's sent if successful
        // Create a waiting alert for player 1 until player two connects
        // When a player two reference has been made, get data from the database and save to reference variable
        //fill data in connected if with firebase data, rather than local
